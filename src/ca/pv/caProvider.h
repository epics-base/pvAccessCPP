 * @brief  CAClientFactory is a channel provider for the ca network provider.

 * A single instance is created the first time CAClientFactory::start is called.
 * epicsAtExit is used to destroy the instance.
 *
 * The single instance calls:
 *      ca_context_create(ca_enable_preemptive_callback);
 *
 * The thread that calls start, or a ca auxillary thread, are the only threads
 * that can call the ca_* functions.
 *
 * NOTE: callbacks for monitor, get, and put are made from a separate thread.
 *    This is done to prevent a deadly embrace that can occur
 *         when rapid gets, puts, and monitor events are happening.
 *    The callbacks should not call any pvAccess method.
 *    If any such call is made the separate thread becomes a ca auxillary thread.
